emacs-starter --- Neat emacs initialization setup

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. About
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Inpired and initially based on Phil Hagelberg's Emacs Starter kit ->
http://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit

If you want to try Emacs, start with this article ->
http://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/effective-emacs

I also highly recommend watching this screencast:
http://peepcode.com/products/meet-emacs

Browse and have handy:
Emacs Lisp manual (language in which you customize Emacs) ->
http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/elisp.html
Emacs Editor manual ->
http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/emacs.html

Read the code to see what this initialization script does.

Configuration assumes that user sets his own settings via Emacs custom
variables and others within config.el file (config.el is not present by
default).

If you like this setup I encourage you to fork it and customize it up to your
liking. If you feel some things could be better with benefit to other users,
I'll be more than happy to pull changes from you.
