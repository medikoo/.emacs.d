;; A simple minor-mode to display the point in the status bar.


;;; Change log:
;;
;; version 0.1
;; * initial release



;;; Code:

(provide 'show-point-mode)


(defvar show-point-value nil
	"Variable used to store point value for display in mode-line.")
(make-variable-buffer-local 'show-point-value)


;; add point display to mode-line construct
(let ((linenum-format (assq 'line-number-mode mode-line-position)))
	(setq mode-line-position
				(assq-delete-all 'line-number-mode mode-line-position))
	(setq mode-line-position
				(append mode-line-position
								`((show-point-mode
									 (line-number-mode
										((column-number-mode
											(15 " (%l,%c)(" show-point-value ")")
											(10 " L%l(" show-point-value ")")))
										((column-number-mode
											(10 " C%c(" show-point-value ")"))))
									 ,linenum-format))))
	)


(define-minor-mode show-point-mode
	"Toggle show-point mode.
With no argument, this command toggles the mode.
A non-null prefix argument turns the mode on.
A null prefix argument turns it off.

Note that simply setting the minor-mode variable
`predictive-which-dict-mode' is not sufficient to enable
predictive mode."

	;; initial value, mode-line indicator, and keymap
	nil nil nil

	;; if show-point-mode had been turned on, add update function to
	;; `post-command-hook'
	(if show-point-mode
			(add-hook 'post-command-hook 'show-point-modeline-update nil t)
		(remove-hook 'post-command-hook 'show-point-modeline-update t))
	)


(defun show-point-modeline-update nil
	;; Update variable storing point position for display in mode line.
	(setq show-point-value (format "%d" (point))))


;;; show-point-mode.el ends here
